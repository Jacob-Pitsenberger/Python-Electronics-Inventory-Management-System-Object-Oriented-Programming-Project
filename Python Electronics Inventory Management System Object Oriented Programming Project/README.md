# Python Electronics Inventory Management System

Welcome to the Python Electronics Inventory Management System project repository! This project is a demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python for managing an electronic parts inventory.

## Course Information

This project was completed as a part of the Object-Oriented Programming (Python) course during the Fall 2021 semester.

## Project Overview

The Python Electronics Inventory Management System is designed to efficiently handle the tracking, updating, and display of electronic components. The system allows users to perform the following operations:

- Look up a part
- Change the quantity of an existing part
- Add a new part
- Display all parts in the inventory

## Key Features

- Utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Implements a `Part` class to store information about electronic components
- Manages inventory through a menu-driven program
- Uses file handling (Pickle) for data persistence
- Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the inventory

## File Structure

- **`part.py`**: Defines the `Part` class for storing part information.
- **`parts_manager.py`**: The main program managing the inventory, implementing the menu system and user interactions.
- **`parts.dat`**: Data file storing the serialized inventory using Pickle.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-electronics-inventory.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd python-electronics-inventory`
3. Run the program: `python parts_manager.py`

## Usage

Follow the on-screen instructions to perform various operations within the inventory management system.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
